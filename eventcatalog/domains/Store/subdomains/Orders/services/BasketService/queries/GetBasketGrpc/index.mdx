## Overview

This gRPC endpoint follows Domain-Driven Design principles to retrieve a specific Basket aggregate root from the Orders bounded context by its user identifier. The operation is implemented as a query that doesn't modify state, adhering to CQRS patterns.

The query handler maps the domain entity to a BasketDto response through an auto-mapper profile, ensuring that domain implementation details remain encapsulated. The endpoint respects the aggregate boundaries and only exposes data appropriate for the presentation layer.

## Usage

```bash
grpcurl api.bookworm.com:50051 bookworm.orders.services.BasketService.GetBasket -d '{"userId": "user-id"}'
```
