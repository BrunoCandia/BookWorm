# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status

**Accepted** - July 2024

## Context

BookWorm needs to demonstrate modern cloud-native patterns while maintaining educational value. The system must support:

- Independent development and deployment of different business capabilities
- Scalability for different service workloads
- Technology diversity for educational purposes
- Team autonomy in development practices
- Fault isolation and system resilience

The monolithic approach would be simpler but wouldn't demonstrate the complexities and benefits of distributed systems that are common in enterprise applications.

## Decision

Adopt a microservices architecture with domain-driven service boundaries.

### Service Boundaries

The system is decomposed into the following services based on business capabilities:

- **Catalog Service**: Book and author management
- **Ordering Service**: Purchase transactions and order management
- **Basket Service**: Shopping cart functionality
- **Rating Service**: Book reviews and ratings
- **Chat Service**: AI-powered book recommendations
- **Notification Service**: User communications
- **Finance Service**: Payment processing and financial transactions

### Design Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services align with business domains
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear business purpose
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data and database
- **API-First**: Well-defined service contracts
- **Autonomous Teams**: Services can be developed independently

## Rationale

### Why Microservices?

1. **Educational Value**: Demonstrates modern enterprise patterns
2. **Scalability**: Different services have different scaling requirements
3. **Technology Diversity**: Can showcase different .NET technologies
4. **Team Simulation**: Models real-world development scenarios
5. **Cloud-Native Alignment**: Works well with .NET Aspire and Azure

### Service Decomposition Strategy

Services were identified using:

- Business capability mapping
- Data ownership boundaries
- Team organization considerations
- Scalability requirements
- Technology demonstration needs

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed separately
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on services
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't crash the entire system
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates real-world enterprise patterns

### Negative Outcomes

- **Operational Complexity**: More services to monitor and manage
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Distributed System Challenges**:
  - Data consistency across services
  - Distributed transaction management
  - Complex monitoring and debugging
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more complex
- **Development Overhead**: More infrastructure and deployment setup

### Risk Mitigation

- **Service Mesh**: Consider implementing for complex routing and observability
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement resilience patterns
- **Distributed Tracing**: Use OpenTelemetry for observability
- **API Versioning**: Implement versioning strategy early
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear service contracts and documentation

## Alternatives Considered

### Modular Monolith

- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, better performance, easier testing
- **Cons**: Less scalable, limited technology diversity, single point of failure
- **Why Rejected**: Doesn't demonstrate cloud-native patterns

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

- **Pros**: Service reuse, enterprise integration patterns
- **Cons**: Too heavyweight, complex governance requirements
- **Why Rejected**: Overkill for the project scope and educational goals

## Implementation Notes

- Services communicate via HTTP APIs and events
- Each service has its own database
- API Gateway provides unified entry point
- Service discovery handled by .NET Aspire
- Observability through OpenTelemetry
