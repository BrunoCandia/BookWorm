const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
	.withUrl("wss://api.bookworm.com/api/v1/chats/stream", {
    accessTokenFactory: ()
    	return "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";
	})
	.withAutomaticReconnect()
	.build();

await connection.start();

connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (message) => {
	console.log("Received message:", message);
});

connection.onclose(() => {
	console.log("Connection closed");
});

connection.onreconnected(() => {
