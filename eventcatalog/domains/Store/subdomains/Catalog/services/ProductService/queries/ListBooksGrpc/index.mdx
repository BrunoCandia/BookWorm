## Overview

This gRPC endpoint follows Domain-Driven Design principles to retrieve a list of Book aggregate roots from the Catalog bounded context. The operation is implemented as a query that doesn't modify state, adhering to CQRS patterns.

The query handler maps the domain entities to a list of BookDto responses through an auto-mapper profile, ensuring that domain implementation details remain encapsulated. The endpoint respects the aggregate boundaries and only exposes data appropriate for the presentation layer.

## Usage

### Call ListBooks using grpcurl

You can use [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) to call the `GetBooks` (or `ListBooks`) method of the `BookGrpcService` defined in your `book.proto`:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -d '{"bookIds": ["<BOOK_ID_1>", "<BOOK_ID_2>"]}' \
  localhost:5001 \
  CatalogApi.BookGrpcService/GetBooks
```

- Replace `<BOOK_ID_1>`, `<BOOK_ID_2>`, etc. with actual book IDs (strings). To list all books, you may pass an empty array or omit the field if supported by your implementation.
- Adjust the host/port (`localhost:5001`) as needed for your environment.
- The response will be a `BooksResponse` message as defined in your proto:

```json title="200 OK"
{
  "books": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "...",
      "price": { "units": 12, "nanos": 0 },
      "priceSale": { "units": 10, "nanos": 0 },
      "status": "InStock"
    },
    // ... more books ...
  ]
}
```
