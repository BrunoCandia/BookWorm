### Event-Driven Communication

#### Saga Patterns

**Orchestration Saga**: Used for complex business processes requiring centralized control

- Order processing workflow
- Compensation handling for failed transactions

**Choreography Saga**: Used for loosely coupled domain interactions

- Catalog updates triggering search index refresh
- User actions generating analytics events
- Cross-domain notifications

#### Event Patterns

| Pattern            | Implementation                          | Use Case                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Outbox Pattern** | Database transaction + event publishing | Ensuring reliable event publishing       |
| **Inbox Pattern**  | Idempotent event processing             | Preventing duplicate event handling      |
| **Event Sourcing** | Domain events as source of truth        | Audit trail and temporal queries         |
| **CQRS**           | Separate read/write models              | Optimized queries and command processing |

## 4.3 Quality Assurance Strategy

### Quality Attributes Implementation

| Quality Attribute   | Implementation Strategy                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**     | Horizontal scaling with container orchestration, stateless services, async processing |
| **Reliability**     | Circuit breakers, retry policies, health checks, graceful degradation                 |
| **Performance**     | Caching strategies, optimized queries, CDN usage, async operations                    |
| **Security**        | OAuth 2.0/OIDC, HTTPS everywhere, input validation, audit logging                     |
| **Maintainability** | Clean architecture, automated testing, comprehensive documentation                    |
| **Observability**   | Distributed tracing, structured logging, metrics collection, health monitoring        |

## 4.4 Deployment Strategy

### Container-First Approach

All services are containerized using Docker with multi-stage builds for optimized image sizes and security.

### Infrastructure as Code

- **Azure Bicep** templates for infrastructure provisioning
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline automation

### Environment Strategy

| Environment     | Purpose             | Deployment Method                 |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Development** | Local development   | Docker Compose + .NET Aspire      |
| **Staging**     | Integration testing | Azure Container Apps (staging)    |
| **Production**  | Live system         | Azure Container Apps (production) |

## 4.5 Security Strategy

### Authentication and Authorization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway
    participant Keycloak
    participant Service

    Client->>Gateway: Request with credentials
    Gateway->>Keycloak: Validate token
    Keycloak-->>Gateway: Token validation response
    Gateway->>Service: Forward request with user context
    Service-->>Gateway: Response
    Gateway-->>Client: Response
```

### Security Measures

| Security Layer    | Implementation                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**   | Rate limiting, request validation, token verification            |
| **Service Level** | Authorization policies, input validation, output encoding        |
| **Data Layer**    | Encryption at rest, secure connection strings, backup encryption |
| **Network**       | HTTPS/TLS, network segmentation, WAF protection                  |
| **Monitoring**    | Security event logging, anomaly detection, audit trails          |

## 4.6 AI Integration Strategy

### AI Services Architecture

- **Text Embedding**: Nomic Embed Text for semantic search capabilities
- **Conversational AI**: Gemma 3 for intelligent chatbot interactions
- **Search Enhancement**: AI-powered search with natural language understanding
