## Overview

This gRPC endpoint follows Domain-Driven Design principles to retrieve a specific Book aggregate root from the Catalog bounded context by its unique identifier. The operation is implemented as a query that doesn't modify state, adhering to CQRS patterns.

The query handler maps the domain entity to a BookDto response through an auto-mapper profile, ensuring that domain implementation details remain encapsulated. The endpoint respects the aggregate boundaries and only exposes data appropriate for the presentation layer.
