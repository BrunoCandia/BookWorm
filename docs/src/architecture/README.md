# arc42 Architecture Documentation

This section contains the detailed architecture documentation for BookWorm following the arc42 template structure.

## About arc42

arc42 is a template for documentation and communication of software and system architectures. It provides a consistent structure for documenting architectures that is:

- **Pragmatic** - focuses on content, not form
- **Flexible** - adaptable to your specific needs
- **Clear** - well-structured and easy to navigate
- **Comprehensive** - covers all important aspects

## Documentation Sections

The architecture documentation is organized into 12 main sections:

1. **[Introduction and Goals](01-introduction-goals.md)** - Why does this system exist?
2. **[Constraints](02-constraints.md)** - What are the fixed constraints?
3. **[Context and Scope](03-context-scope.md)** - What are the system boundaries?
4. **[Solution Strategy](04-solution-strategy.md)** - How do we achieve our goals?
5. **[Building Block View](05-building-block-view.md)** - How is the system structured?
6. **[Runtime View](06-runtime-view.md)** - How does the system behave at runtime?
7. **[Deployment View](07-deployment-view.md)** - How is the system deployed?
8. **[Cross-cutting Concepts](08-cross-cutting-concepts.md)** - What are the overarching concepts?
9. **[Architecture Decisions](09-architecture-decisions.md)** - What are the key decisions? ([Individual ADRs](adr/))
10. **[Quality Requirements](10-quality-requirements.md)** - What quality attributes matter?
11. **[Risks and Technical Debt](11-risks-technical-debt.md)** - What are the known issues?
12. **[Glossary](12-glossary.md)** - What do the terms mean?

Each section provides detailed information about different aspects of the BookWorm architecture, from high-level goals to specific implementation details.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Section 9 uses a multi-page ADR approach for better organization and maintainability:

- **[Main ADR Index](09-architecture-decisions.md)** - Overview, timeline, and decision impact analysis
- **[Individual ADR Directory](adr/)** - Detailed individual Architecture Decision Records
  - [ADR-001: Microservices Architecture](adr/adr-001-microservices-architecture.md)
  - [ADR-002: Event-Driven Architecture with CQRS](adr/adr-002-event-driven-cqrs.md)
  - [ADR-003: .NET Aspire for Cloud-Native Development](adr/adr-003-aspire-cloud-native.md)
  - [ADR-004: PostgreSQL as Primary Database](adr/adr-004-postgresql-database.md)
  - [ADR-005: Keycloak for Identity Management](adr/adr-005-keycloak-identity.md)
  - [ADR-006: SignalR for Real-time Communication](adr/adr-006-signalr-realtime.md)
  - [ADR-007: Container-First Deployment Strategy](adr/adr-007-container-deployment.md)
  - [ADR-008: API Gateway Pattern Implementation](adr/adr-008-api-gateway.md)
  - [ADR-009: AI Integration Strategy](adr/adr-009-ai-integration.md)

This structure allows for:

- **Better Navigation**: Each decision is in its own file for easy reference
- **Version Control**: Individual ADR changes can be tracked separately
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and review specific decisions
- **Cross-Referencing**: Clear links between related decisions

## Navigation Tips

- Start with the main ADR index for an overview of all decisions
- Use the decision timeline to understand the evolution of the architecture
- Check the decision impact matrix to understand quality attribute implications
- Follow the dependency diagram to understand how decisions relate to each other
